# OrbitronTactics — CLAUDE.md

## Overview

Flutter 2-player chess variant with custom piece movement, power field domination victory conditions, and Supabase Realtime multiplayer. Supports local hot-seat, single player against an on-device AI, and cloud lobby.

## Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d android
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
flutter analyze
flutter test --exclude-tags slow   # what CI runs
flutter test --tags slow           # AI self-play: Hard vs Medium, ~1 min
```

## Dependencies

- `flutter_riverpod` — state management (StateNotifier)
- `freezed` / `json_serializable` — immutable game models
- `supabase_flutter` — lobby and realtime multiplayer
- `shared_preferences` — fleet progress, one JSON blob per fleet under `fleet_progress.<identity>`

## Single Player AI

- `GameMode.singlePlayer` in `GameStateNotifier`; `AiOpponentController` (`aiOpponentProvider`, watched by `GameScreen`) plays the AI's turns and books battle rewards and game results.
- `AiProfile` holds all tunables per difficulty. Easy/Medium use `GreedyAi` (one ply); Hard uses `SearchAi` (alpha-beta, captures as chance nodes weighted by `BattleOdds`), run via `compute()`.
- `BattleAi` pilots the AI ship; `BattleStateNotifier` applies its actions on the engine every tick.
- Fleet identities: `player`, `ai-easy`, `ai-medium`, `ai-hard`. `FleetProgression.spend` keeps an AI fleet's total upgrade levels within the player's plus the profile's rubber-band offset.

## Battle Arena

- `BattleEngine` ticks the fight. Ships have `xFraction` and `altitude` (0–1); a `Projectile` keeps its shooter's lane and altitude and hits only within `hitHalfWidth` and `hitHalfAltitude`. Shots arriving on target are logged in `BattleState.impacts` for the effects.
- `BattleScreen` input: in your half the finger's x sets the ship's position, dragging forward (toward the enemy) climbs and back dives. `ShipMovedEvent` carries both to the opponent; `BattleAi` returns a target position and altitude.
- `BattleArenaPainter` shows altitude as size and shadow, banks ships by their sideways speed (`ShipBank`), and draws shots and `ExplosionFx` in the shooter's `BattleElement` (pawn kinetic, knight water, bishop fire, rook ice, queen and king electric). The loser's explosion plays before the result overlay.

## Fleet Ship Art

- `assets/fleets/<slug>/<unit>_<white|black>.png`: 10 fleets × 6 unit types × 2 colors, 256 px, bow up. `FleetSkin` (`features/battle/data/fleet_skin.dart`) maps slugs to asset paths; `fleet_skin_test` keeps the enum, the files and the pubspec asset folders in sync.
- `BattleArenaPainter` draws the sprites (decoded by `shipSpriteProvider`) sized as a fraction of the arena width and turns the top ship around; without a sprite it draws the vector hull.
- The player's fleet is `FleetProgress.skin`, picked in the Comcenter; each difficulty's is `AiProfile.fleetSkin`. Only single player uses them (`AiOpponentController.skinFor`); other modes fly `FleetSkin.fallback` (Vanguard).

## Supabase Integration

- **Realtime Broadcast** — move sync between players (~20-50ms)
- **Presence** — detect opponent disconnect
- **DB** — lobby/session management

Configure in app: set Supabase URL and anon key (check `lib/core/` for config).

## Game Rules

- 8×8 board, custom piece types and movement
- 5 power fields — control majority to win
- Threat indicators: red badge on pieces in danger
- Local hot-seat mode: two players, one device

## Platforms

iOS, Android, Windows.
